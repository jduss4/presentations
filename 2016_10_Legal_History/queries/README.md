# Part 3: Querying Datasets with SPARQL

Please browse the examples in this directory and try them out on your own!

If the query deals with dbpedia, make sure you use this SPARQLer:

[dbpedia sparqler](http://dbpedia.org/sparql)

For all other datasets, use this one:

[SPARQLer](http://www.sparql.org/sparql.html)

## Available Datasets

- [dbpedia sparqler](http://dbpedia.org/sparql)
- [data.gov](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset) (filter by RDF)
- [OSCYS](http://earlywashingtondc.org/rdf/oscys.relationships.ttl) (large file)

For this workshop, I recommend using either dbpedia or OSCYS.

Conveniently, I have written a blogpost which steps through some of the larger queries that power OSCYS's visualizations and relationship finders.
